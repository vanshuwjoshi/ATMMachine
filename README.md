# ATMMachineJava

This Java project is a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation that leverages object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to provide the following functionalities:

1. Check the PIN entered by the user.
2. Check account balance.
3. Withdraw money from the account.
4. Deposit money into the account.

The ATM simulation provides the following functionalities:

### 1. Check the PIN entered by the user

The user is prompted to enter their PIN. The system verifies the PIN against a predefined value. If the entered PIN matches, the user gains access to their account; otherwise, access is denied.

### 2. Check Balance

Once authenticated, the user can check their account balance. The system displays the current balance.

### 3. Withdraw Money

Authenticated users can withdraw money from their accounts. They specify the amount they wish to withdraw, and the system deducts this amount from their balance if it's available. It provides feedback on the successful or unsuccessful transaction.

### 4. Deposit Money

Users can deposit money into their accounts. They specify the amount they want to deposit, and the system adds this amount to their balance.
